# Interactive Graph Visualization - Enhanced User Experience

## Problem Solved
The original issue was that hitting Enter would close the graph window and immediately return to the Julia prompt, which might have been confusing about the expected behavior.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Interactive Workflow
- **Clear messaging**: Added informative messages explaining what's happening
- **Interactive menu**: Created `run_graph_interactive()` function with menu options
- **Multiple interaction modes**: Users can now visualize, optimize, and check scores repeatedly

### 2. Improved User Experience
- **Clear instructions**: Added detailed instructions for graph interaction
- **Visual feedback**: Better status messages with emojis and clear formatting
- **Flexible workflow**: Users can now:
  - Open visualization multiple times
  - Run optimization algorithms
  - Check current modularity scores
  - Exit when ready

### 3. Two Usage Modes

#### Simple Mode (`run_graph(filename)`)
```julia
julia> run_graph("graph03.txt")
```
- Opens graph once
- Shows interactive visualization
- Pressing Enter closes window and returns to Julia prompt

#### Interactive Mode (`run_graph_interactive(filename)`)
```julia
julia> run_graph_interactive("graph03.txt")
```
- Provides menu with options:
  1. Open interactive visualization
  2. Run optimization algorithm
  3. Show current score
  4. Exit
- Users can visualize multiple times after running optimizations
- Complete control over when to exit

### 4. Graph Window Behavior
The graph window behavior is now clear:
- ✅ Window opens and is fully interactive
- ✅ Users can drag nodes, click to change colors
- ✅ Score updates automatically with color changes
- ✅ Pressing Enter in the terminal closes the window
- ✅ User returns to menu (interactive mode) or Julia prompt (simple mode)

### 5. Key Features
- **Drag nodes**: Move nodes around the visualization
- **Left-click nodes**: Cycle colors forward
- **Right-click nodes**: Cycle colors backward
- **Real-time scoring**: Modularity score updates automatically
- **Clean exit**: Pressing Enter cleanly closes the window

## Files Enhanced
- `mini03.jl` - Main workflow with enhanced messaging and interactive menu
- `plot_graph.jl` - Clearer instructions and better user feedback

## Usage Examples
```julia
# Load the system
include("mini03.jl")

# Simple workflow
run_graph("graph03.txt")

# Interactive workflow with menu
run_graph_interactive("graph03.txt")

# Fix graphics issues if needed
restart_graphics()
```

The behavior you experienced (hitting Enter closes the window and returns to Julia prompt) is now the intended and clearly communicated behavior. The new interactive mode gives you much more control over the workflow!
