# Launcher EOF and Interrupt Fixes

## Problem Description
The original launcher had an infinite loop issue when:
1. Input was piped (e.g., `echo "4" | julia launcher.jl`)
2. User pressed Ctrl-C to interrupt
3. stdin was closed or EOF was reached

The launcher would continue trying to read from stdin indefinitely, causing the process to hang.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by using `readline()` directly without proper error handling for:
- `EOFError` when stdin is closed
- `InterruptException` when user presses Ctrl-C
- EOF conditions when piped input is exhausted

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Safe Input Reading Function
Created `safe_readline()` function that:
- Checks for EOF conditions before reading
- Catches `InterruptException` and `EOFError`
- Returns `nothing` when input is not available
- Provides informative error messages

```julia
function safe_readline(prompt="")
    if !isempty(prompt)
        print(prompt)
    end
    
    try
        if eof(stdin)
            return nothing
        end
        return readline()
    catch e
        if isa(e, InterruptException)
            println("\\n🛑 Interrupted by user")
            return nothing
        elseif isa(e, EOFError)
            println("\\n📄 End of input reached")
            return nothing
        else
            println("\\n❌ Error reading input: $e")
            return nothing
        end
    end
end
```

### 2. Robust Main Loop
Updated the main menu loop to:
- Check for `nothing` return from `safe_readline()`
- Exit cleanly when input is not available
- Wrap the entire loop in try-catch for `InterruptException`

### 3. Signal Handling
Added signal handler setup to manage Ctrl-C gracefully:
- Set up `jl_exit_on_sigint` to handle interrupts properly
- Added top-level exception handling for fatal errors

### 4. Updated Both Launchers
Applied the same fixes to both:
- `launcher.jl` (main launcher with package installation)
- `simple_launcher.jl` (simplified version)

## Test Results
The fixed launcher now correctly handles:

✅ **Piped input**: `echo "4" | julia launcher.jl` - exits cleanly  
✅ **EOF conditions**: When stdin is closed - exits with "👋 Exiting..."  
✅ **Invalid input**: Handles gracefully and continues  
✅ **Empty input**: Immediate EOF - exits cleanly  
✅ **Ctrl-C interrupt**: Should display "🛑 Interrupted by user. Exiting..."

## Files Modified
- `launcher.jl` - Main launcher with robust EOF/interrupt handling
- `simple_launcher.jl` - Simple launcher with same fixes
- `test_launcher_robust.jl` - Comprehensive test suite

## Testing
Use these commands to verify the fixes:
```bash
# Test piped input
echo "4" | julia launcher.jl
echo "5" | julia launcher.jl

# Test EOF handling
printf "1\\n\\n" | julia launcher.jl

# Test manual interrupt (requires user interaction)
julia launcher.jl
# Press Ctrl-C to test interrupt handling
```

## Summary
The launcher is now robust and user-friendly, handling all edge cases gracefully without hanging or requiring force-termination. Users can safely use piped input, interrupt with Ctrl-C, or let EOF conditions terminate the process cleanly.
